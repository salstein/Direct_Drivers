        '(new born babies) services. \n\nThe App provides some form of easy access and connection between patients '
        'and specialists. It is where patients could easily access specialists for consultations on medical '
        'challenges as it relates to antenatal, neonatal and other related issues. \n\nThe App will also provide an '
        'avenue where patients and App users can get easy access to information on antenatal, neonatal and other '
        'related issues. \n\nThe App is programmed to remind App users of their physical and virtual appointments with '
        'specialists. \n\nIn order to access certain services, you may be required to create an account. '
        'If you do so, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account. '
        'You further agree to accept all responsibility for actions and activities that occur using that account. '
        '\n\nIn all cases, our ability to deliver all the functionality of the services requires a stable '
        'data connection and access to location services like GPS. If your computer device (phone, laptop, etc) '
        'ability to access data via wireless networks or the internet is compromised, the services may be '
        'delivered incompletely, slowly, inaccurately, or not at all. These connectivity problems can arise '
        'from many sources, ranging from physical interference to power outages to errors by '
        'telecommunication providers. Once again, your ability to effectively use the App or '
        'services may be compromised through no fault of ours, and we cannot accept any responsibility for '
        'any problems or damages which might occur. \n\nThe services rendered also depend on your device. '
        'If your device is damaged, not compatible with the App (including updates to the App), or if you '
        'have turned off permissions on which the App relies to deliver all the functionality of the services '
        '(such as location sharing), then your ability to effectively use the App or services may be compromised '
        'through no fault of ours, and we cannot accept any responsibility for any problems or damages '
        'which might occur. \n\nFrom time to time we may need to make the App or the services unavailable in '
        'order to fix bugs, perform maintenance, install updates, or similar tasks that improve the overall '
        'service we deliver. We make every effort to do so during times that have the least impact, '
        'but we cannot accept any responsibility for problems or damages that occur because of App or services '
        'unavailability for these reasons. \n\nFinally, our ability to effectively deliver the services via the '
        'App depends on you having access to the latest version of the App. If you delay or refuse updates '
        'to the App, this may compromise or completely prevent us from delivering the services. We cannot accept '
        'any responsibility for any problems or damages which might occur.',
